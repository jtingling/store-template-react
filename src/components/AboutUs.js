                <h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
                <p>
                    Bibisama aims to be the first true Otaku clothing brand that positively represents the
                    culture and art style unique to the genre. Using premium materials, original art designs, 
                    and high-tech manufacturing, we have created an Asian pop-culture inspired streetwear that 
                    is comfortable to wear at home, yet stylish during a night out. Vertical integration allows 
                    Bibisama to maintain a high quality standard and complete artistic freedom. With owning our 
                    supply chain, we are able to transform creative concepts into physical reality. Furthermore, 
                    we are proud to pay our employees ethical wages and source materials only from responsible 
                    suppliers. At Bibisama, we embody the Otaku culture and are proud to present our work to a worldwide audience.

                <h3>Our Story</h3>
                <p> 
                    In 1994, I got sucked into the world of Final Fantasy 6 without knowing how to navigate the Japanese 
                    menus. In 1997, I started reading a humble Japanese manga, later known to the world as One Piece. 
                    Growing up in both Beijing and Toronto, anime and gaming played a huge role in my personal development. 
                    What I loved the most was that anime allowed me to immerse myself into different worlds and cultures by 
                    using the combination of captivating art styles and engaging stories. As years went on, I kept wishing 
                    that there was a tasteful clothing brand that represented this part of me. A brand that celebrated the 
                    beauty of the art, culture and styles born from manga; but there was nothing. Nothing I would be proud 
                    of wearing, at least, not for a long time. More recently, anime has become a global phenomenon that is 
                    loved and cherished globally. Old series are now available online for streaming. Manga has been translated 
                    and is available at major book stores. Artists and studios from all around the world started to adopt 
                    anime's unique art style into their own work. Now, amazing artwork, series and collaborations are being 
                    created internationally. Anime, which used to be a subculture, is now celebrated internationally. This is 
                    currently the Golden Age to be an Anime fan. But to this day, very few clothing brands are able to represent 
                    this culture in a positive manner. The few brands that exist tend to just take official artwork and slap it on 
                    a T-Shirt, labeling it as Anime merchandise without any thought behind the quality or subtleties in the product. 
                    To have an article of clothing that was stylish enough to wear among people that are not into this culture was 
                    unthinkable. In an age where everyone is embracing the Otaku culture, in an era where there are amazing 
                    artists and artwork out there: there aren't many brands doing the culture justice. Looking at my friends 
                    in other subcultures; whether it's the hip hop, athletic, high fashion, or indie scenes, I couldn't help 
                    but notice the high quality and unique street apparel options available to them. Options that allowed them 
                    to proudly and boldly express themselves. I was a bit upset and kind of frustrated at the options available 
                    to anime and gaming fans. at is when I started Bibisama.
